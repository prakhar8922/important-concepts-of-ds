stoi function is used to convert a string into int .
it can also be used for converting binary numbers into decimal numbers.
stoi(name of variable containing the string,starting index generally 0 ,base of the string )

 Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm: 
Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit. 
for example : 
10 in binary is 00001010 
9 in binary is 00001001 
8 in binary is 00001000 
7 in binary is 00000111 
So if we subtract a number by 1 and do it bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit. If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the number of times the loop executes, we get the set bit count. 
The beauty of this solution is the number of times it loops is equal to the number of set bits in a given integer. 


bitset<32>(x) converts a number x into its binary form while taking 32 places.
bitset<32>(x).to_string() converts the binary number into string.

stoll(str, 0, 2) convert the string str from base 2 to a decimal number and returns it in the form of long long.

if
n&(n+1)=0 then all the bits of the number is set. all n=2^n-1 numbers have all  their bits set.

hexadecimal 0xaaaaaaaa represents binary with even positions set as 1.						
 0x55555555 represents binary with odd positions set as 1
